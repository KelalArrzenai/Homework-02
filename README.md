# Homework-02

## Overview

This week, I decided to challenge myself with building, not just a web page, but a full website with multiple pages. It was designed as a place to centralize all my work so it can be viewed by anyone. Acting primarily as a portfolio in this regard.  

However, I also took it upon myself to attempt almost all of my styles through the use of bootstrap to take a load off. While at the outset this seemed simple, I found I was spending most of my time on google trying to learn how bootstrap worked.

A worthy excersize, as I feel I have not only learned much, but that this new-found knowledge will be all but necessary in my continued pursuit of this new career.
